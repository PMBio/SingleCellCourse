# Single Cell Course

## Description:
This course provides insights into the latest developments in single cell biology for computational students. The course is aimed specifically for students with experience in R/Python programming, eager to apply and broaden their skills in single cell genomics setting. This is a three day course, consisting of lectures in the morning and practicals in the afternoon. 

- [Day 1](day1/):  will provide an introduction on single cell RNA sequencing processing data
- [Day 2](day2/):  will focus on methods for integration of data from different batches as well as different molecular layers. 
- [Day 3](day3/):    will introduce recent developments such as novel spatially-resolved single cell methods. 

Within the practicum we will be reanalysing existing multi-omic single cell data, to get hands on experience working with the data.
